        <li>Crispy Garlic Parmesan Fries</li>
        Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Wash the potatoes thoroughly and cut them into evenly sized fries, about 1/4-inch thick.
In a large bowl, toss the potato fries with olive oil, minced garlic, salt, and pepper until well coated.
Arrange the seasoned fries in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet, ensuring they are not crowded.
Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for about 30-35 minutes, or until the fries are golden brown and crispy. Flip them halfway through baking to ensure even browning.
While the fries are baking, mix together the grated Parmesan cheese and dried parsley in a small bowl.
Once the fries are done, remove them from the oven and sprinkle the Parmesan cheese mixture over the top.
Return the baking sheet to the oven for an additional 2-3
