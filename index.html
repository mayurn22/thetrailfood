      </p>Hi FOOD LOVERS, and thanks for visiting my blog post! This is my first article in which I just want to introduce the Art of Food Blogging.

The experience of writing a food blog should be memorable and special like the time you made your mother cry by telling her that you didn't think marriage was your thing.

I love books. I love food. Ever since I was a little kid I have had this immense passion for cooking.

I thought to myself. Why not share with the rest of the world wholesome healthy foods and ways to be happy and healthy that will keep even the most snobby foodie asking for more.

So here you will be able to find loads of fun including healthy recipes to tantalize your taste buds or treat your family.

You will catch the health and fitness news, facts and great recipes.
